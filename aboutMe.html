    <p>Hello readers! I am Cameron Rowberry and here is a little bit about me. I am majoring in Web Design and Development with a minor in Computer Programming.</p>
    <p>I love to play Magic: The Gathering and any other board or card game. Tennis is my favorite sport, although I do not play it much. I also draw, dragons mainly, but I also do scenery and animals.</p>
    <p>I have been a member for as long as I have lived. I do not have a favorite quote or scripture.</p>
